        Kargil Vijay Diwas, named after the successful Operation 
        Vijay, is celebrated in India on 26 July. On this date in 
        1999, India successfully took command of the high outposts
         which had been lost to Pakistan. The Kargil war was fought 
         or more
         than 60 days, ended on 26 July and resulted in loss of 
         life on both the sides. The war ended with India regaining 
         control of all the previously held territory, 
         hence re-establishing the status quo ante bellum.
          Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year 
          in honour of the Kargil War's Heroes. This day is 
          celebrated in the Kargil–Dras sector and the national
           capital New Delhi, where the Prime Minister of India 
           pays homage to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyoti at 
           India Gate every year. Functions are also organized all 
           over the country 
           to commemorate the contributions of the armed forces.

  "After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, 
  there had been a long period with relatively
   few direct armed conflicts involving the military
    forces of the two neighbours – notwithstanding the 
    efforts of both nations to control the Siachen Glacier
     by establishing military outposts on the 
  surrounding mountains ridges and the resulting 
  military skirmishes in the 1980."
